# turtleTag
I made this game in 2017 when I was still trying out Python.
It's the first game I've ever made. I used the turtle library in Python to draw to the screen. Since it was my first ever game, it's pretty bad code (horrible space complexity, no use of classes, etc) but I was pretty proud of it at the time.
