# turtleTag
I made this game in 2017 when I was still trying out Python.
It's the first game I've ever made. I used the turtle library in Python to draw to the screen. Since it was my first ever game, it's pretty bad code (horrible space complexity, no use of classes, etc) but I was pretty proud of it at the time.

# Final Version
Obviously I've moved on to working on better things now, but as of 2018, this game has 2 modes, single player and multiplayer. The single player mode uses a prmitive AI I made to play against the player. Their is also a Rules screen, which explains the rules and controls to the players.

# Controls
**Player 1**

Arrow keys for movement, P for power up


**Player 2**

WASD for movement, Spacebar for powerup

**Rules**

Two turtles play tag. The border of the game area indicates who's it (If it's red, red is it, if it's blue, blue is it). The main purpose of the game is to not get caught by the other player. You can teleport through walls (if you go through the left wall, you'll come back through the right wall). You can also collect powerups by collecting the orange circles. If you're it, the power up allows you to draw a line to trap the person you're catching. If you're not it, the powerup allows you to teleport to a random location (which can help you get away from the person chasing you).
