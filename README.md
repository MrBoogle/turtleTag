# turtleTag
I made this game in 2017 when I was still trying out Python.
It's the first game I've ever made. I used the turtle library in Python to draw to the screen. Since it was my first ever game, it's pretty bad code (horrible space complexity, no use of classes, etc) but I was pretty proud of it at the time.

# Final Version
Obviously I've moved on to working on better things now, but as of 2018, this game has 2 modes, single player and multiplayer. The single player mode uses a prmitive AI I made to play against the player. Their is also a Rules screen, which explains the rules and controls to the players.

# Controls
_Player 1_
Arrow keys for movement, P for power up


_Player 2_
WASD for movement, Spacebar for powerup
